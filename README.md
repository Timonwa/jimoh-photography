# Jimoh's Photography
It is a portfolio created for a photographer to showcase his photographic works.

It is a 4-page website that consists of the following:

- Homepage which shows the photographer's featured photographs,
- About page which gives the biography or professional life of the photographer along with other useful information,
- Gallery which has all his works and
- Contact page which contains the different ways to contact the photographer.

The project was done using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
